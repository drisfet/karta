# Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and their solutions in the Agent Studio.

## Connection Issues

### Nodes Won't Connect
**Symptoms**: Can't draw connections between nodes, error messages about incompatible types

**Solutions**:
1. Check data type compatibility between output and input ports
2. Ensure both nodes are properly configured
3. Try refreshing the canvas (Ctrl+R)
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Data Not Flowing
**Symptoms**: Connections are drawn but no data passes through

**Solutions**:
1. Verify node configurations are complete
2. Check if source node is producing output
3. Ensure destination node can accept the data type
4. Use debug mode to inspect data flow

## Execution Problems

### Workflow Won't Start
**Symptoms**: Run button is disabled or clicking it does nothing

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure all required node configurations are complete
2. Check for unconnected required inputs
3. Verify no circular dependencies exist
4. Check browser console for errors

### Execution Hangs or Freezes
**Symptoms**: Workflow starts but never completes, progress indicator stuck

**Solutions**:
1. Check for infinite loops in logic nodes
2. Verify external service availability (APIs, databases)
3. Review timeout settings on tool nodes
4. Use debug mode to identify the stuck node

### Unexpected Errors
**Symptoms**: Red error indicators on nodes, execution stops

**Solutions**:
1. Click on error indicator to see detailed error message
2. Check node configuration for invalid values
3. Verify API keys and credentials are correct
4. Check network connectivity for external services

## Node-Specific Issues

### Agent Nodes
**Issue**: Agent returns irrelevant results
**Solution**: Adjust agent parameters, provide clearer instructions

**Issue**: Agent times out
**Solution**: Increase timeout settings, simplify the task

### Tool Nodes
**Issue**: Search tool returns no results
**Solution**: Check search query syntax, verify API connectivity

**Issue**: Tool authentication fails
**Solution**: Verify API keys are correctly configured

### Logic Nodes
**Issue**: Condition node always takes wrong branch
**Solution**: Review condition logic, check data types

**Issue**: Loop node runs infinitely
**Solution**: Add proper exit conditions, check loop limits

## Performance Issues

### Slow Execution
**Symptoms**: Workflows take longer than expected to complete

**Solutions**:
1. Optimize node configurations for performance
2. Use parallel processing where possible
3. Implement caching for repeated operations
4. Check system resources (CPU, memory)

### Memory Issues
**Symptoms**: Browser becomes unresponsive, out of memory errors

**Solutions**:
1. Process data in smaller batches
2. Clear unnecessary data between operations
3. Use streaming for large datasets
4. Close other browser tabs to free memory

## UI and Display Issues

### Canvas Not Loading
**Symptoms**: Studio page loads but canvas is blank

**Solutions**:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Try a different browser
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify all required assets are loading

### Nodes Not Dragging Properly
**Symptoms**: Nodes don't move when dragged, or jump unexpectedly

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure mouse is over the node header when dragging
2. Check for browser zoom level issues
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Verify no other elements are interfering

### Property Panel Not Updating
**Symptoms**: Changes in property panel don't reflect in node

**Solutions**:
1. Click outside the input field to commit changes
2. Ensure the node is selected when making changes
3. Try deselecting and reselecting the node
4. Check for validation errors preventing updates

## Browser Compatibility

### Chrome/Chromium Issues
- Ensure latest version is installed
- Disable extensions that might interfere
- Check for conflicting browser settings

### Firefox Issues
- Enable WebGL acceleration
- Check for addon conflicts
- Verify JavaScript is enabled

### Safari Issues
- Ensure latest macOS version
- Enable WebGL and advanced features
- Check for extension conflicts

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode Usage
1. Enable debug mode from the toolbar
2. Step through execution node by node
3. Inspect data at each step
4. View detailed logs and timing information

### Console Logging
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check Console tab for error messages
- Look for network errors in Network tab
- Review Application tab for storage issues

### System Requirements
- **Browser**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB, recommended 8GB+
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor recommended
- **Network**: Stable internet connection required

## Getting Help

If you can't resolve an issue:

1. **Check Documentation**: Review the user guide and technical docs
2. **Use Help Chat**: Ask the built-in help system for assistance
3. **Collect Information**: Note error messages, browser version, steps to reproduce
4. **Report Issues**: Include screenshots and console logs when reporting problems

## Prevention Tips

1. **Regular Backups**: Save workflow templates regularly
2. **Version Control**: Keep track of workflow versions
3. **Testing**: Test workflows with various inputs
4. **Documentation**: Document custom configurations and workarounds
5. **Updates**: Keep browser and system updated
