You're describing the perfect demonstration of the Agent Studio's capabilities! Let me show you how to create and execute that exact workflow:
🎯 YOUR DESIRED WORKFLOW:
Visual Flow:

Researcher Agent → Question Tool → Search Tool → Output Data → Panel Generator

Data Flow:

Prompt → Generate Question → Search Query → Search Results → Display Panel

🚀 HOW TO CREATE THIS WORKFLOW:
Step 1: Start with a Blank Canvas

    Open the studio: http://localhost:3000/studio
    Click "🆕 New" to clear the canvas
    Canvas is now blank and ready

Step 2: Add Your Researcher Node

    Drag "Researcher Agent" from the left palette
    Click on it to open the property panel
    Configure the prompt:
        Model: GPT-4
        Temperature: 0.7
        Max Steps: 5
        Tools: Select "question" and "search"

Step 3: Add Question Tool Node

    Drag "Question Tool" from the palette
    Connect Researcher → Question Tool (drag from output to input)
    Configure:
        Provider: Custom
        Retry Count: 3

Step 4: Add Search Tool Node

    Drag "Search Tool" from the palette
    Connect Question Tool → Search Tool
    Configure:
        Provider: Exa Search
        Retry Count: 3

Step 5: Add Output Data Node

    Drag "Output Data" from the palette
    Connect Search Tool → Output Data
    Configure:
        Data Type: String
        Default Value: "Search results will appear here"

Step 6: Add Panel Generator Node

    Drag "Panel Generator" from the palette
    Connect Output Data → Panel Generator
    Configure:
        Panel Type: SEARCH_RESULTS
        Template: "Search Results Display"

🎬 WHAT YOU'LL SEE DURING EXECUTION:
Step 1: Researcher Agent Processing

    Node turns blue and shows "running"
    Console shows: "Researcher Agent processing prompt"
    Status updates in real-time

Step 2: Question Generation

    Question Tool activates when Researcher finishes
    Visual data flow animation between nodes
    Question generated based on research prompt

Step 3: Search Execution

    Search Tool receives the generated question
    Executes search using configured provider
    Shows progress with status updates

Step 4: Data Output

    Results flow to Output Data node
    Data stored and displayed in node
    Ready for panel generation

Step 5: Panel Display

    Panel Generator creates the UI panel
    Search results displayed in configured panel type
    Complete workflow visualization

🎨 VISUAL FEEDBACK YOU'LL SEE:
Real-time Status Updates:

    ✅ Node colors change: Gray → Blue (running) → Green (completed)
    ✅ Connection animations: Data flowing between nodes
    ✅ Progress indicators: Loading states and completion checkmarks
    ✅ Execution timeline: Step-by-step progress in monitor

Data Flow Visualization:

    ✅ Animated connections: Pulsing lines showing data transfer
    ✅ Node highlights: Active nodes glow during processing
    ✅ Status badges: Running/Completed/Error states
    ✅ Performance metrics: Execution times and success rates

Interactive Monitoring:

    ✅ Execution Monitor: Live updates in right panel
    ✅ Debug controls: Step through each node
    ✅ Artifact display: Rich content from each step
    ✅ Performance analytics: Detailed timing and metrics

🎯 THE COMPLETE EXPERIENCE:
What Makes This Special:

    🔄 Real-time Data Flow: Watch your prompt transform through each node
    📊 Visual Execution: See exactly how each component processes data
    🔍 Step-by-step Debugging: Pause and inspect at any point
    📈 Performance Monitoring: Track timing and success rates
    🎨 Rich UI Integration: See results in actual panel components

Advanced Features You'll Experience:

    Conditional Logic: Add logic nodes for decision-making
    Error Handling: See how failures are handled gracefully
    Template Saving: Save this workflow for reuse
    Plugin Architecture: Extend with custom node types
